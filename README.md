# FactionsPro

A modified plugin, better than ever. Being updated frequently. Edited by the VMPE development team. We update this plugin most of the time, features, bug fixes, and more. If you have any issues, or suggestions on what we should fix / add to this plugin, please open a new issue. We will make sure to read them. Thank you.

## What is this branch?
This branch is called "bug-fixing". It's where if a bug was in this plugin, we'd try and fix it ASAP (Before the other branches). It would be good, so we don't have to keep updating the same branch. Instead, we'd update some other branches to prevent spammy-same branches to be published.

## Features
* All the features from the good 'ol' days are now back, and working with PMMP Latest APi's.

* /f map = Better than ever.

* Factions, more customised, and bigger than ever.

* Prefixes - You can configure the command prefixes in which you can use on every single command.

* F Values - You can use Faction money, balance, withdraw, donate, and more.

* /f say now works - It's better than ever, and /f say is finally working!

* Better Factions help page! Use /f help for the usage!

* /f claim now works as it should - We've fixed /f claim, and it's better than ever!

* /f overclaim now works as it should - In this version of FactionsPro, we've made it so you can Overclaim! This was also introduced in the Old Modded version of this plugin.

* Made configurations so much easier!

* And still updating as we speak!
